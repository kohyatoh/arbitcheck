/**
 * Stores and provides means to access the component sequences generated during
 * a run of Randoop. "Component sequences" are sequences that Randoop uses to
 * create larger sequences.
 * 
 * This class manages different collections of component sequences:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>General components that can be used as input to any method in any class.
 * <li>Class literals: components representing literal values that apply only to
 * a specific class and should not be used as inputs to other classes.
 * <li>Package literals: analogous to class literals but at the package level.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * SEED SEQUENCES. Seed sequences are sequences that were not created during the
 * generation process but obtained via other means. They include (1) sequences
 * passed via the constructor, (2) class literals, and (3) package literals. The
 * only different treatment of seed sequences is during calls to the
 * clearGeneratedSequences() method, which removes only general, non-seed
 * components from the collection.
